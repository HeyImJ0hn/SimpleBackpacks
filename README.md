SimpleBackpacks Plugin for Spigot/Paper 1.18 by GuitarXpress (HeyImJ0hn)

###### Commands:
- /backpacks - Shows backpack recipe

###### Permission node:
- "backpacks.use" - Ability to use/open backpacks

###### Additional Info:
This plugin is, as the name states, a simple backpacks plugin. Backpacks have 27 spaces, same as a small chest.

You can craft as many backpacks as you want but having more than 1 in your inventory will give you slowness. This effect can be removed in the **config.yml** file.
